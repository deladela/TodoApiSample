## To Use This Application In Docker
The application can also be used in Docker, for instance for the Workshop "Have Some Cake With Your Frosting"
* Install and setup Docker (https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* If using Docker on Windows, set Docker to use Linux Containers - either during installation or by right-clicking on the Docker icon in the system tray and choosing Switch to Linux Containers (you can switch back after the workshop)
* Verify your installation (https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#test-docker-installation)
* Run the following command from a command line anywhere on your computer
`docker run -p 8080:80 --name myapp g33klady/todoapi:latest`
This will get the latest docker image with this code running on your machine

To see what is running in Docker
`Docker ps`

To stop a Docker image
`Docker stop myapp`

To start a Docker image back up
`Docker start myapp`

Once Docker is running, application can be accessed:
http://localhost:8080

### Note
You'll need to provide a header with key "CanAccess" and value "true" to use the API via Postman. When using the Swagger specification, select the Authorization button and enter the value "true".
